# Red-Ocean-Theme
This is a css code that I made myself that uses Clear Vision V7 and Vencord css to make my own custom theme. Please give credit if any code is used thank you!

Download Vencord -> https://vencord.dev/download/

Download Clear Vision V7 -> https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v7?tab=readme-ov-file

Place the css file inside Vencord->Settings file.
(Make sure you've enabled Clear Vision V7 and are using my css file)
